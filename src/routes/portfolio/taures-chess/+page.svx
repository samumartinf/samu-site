# {title}

Taures is a high-performance chess engine built from the ground up in Rust, showcasing modern systems programming techniques and advanced algorithms for game AI. This project represents my exploration into game theory, algorithm optimization, and the Rust programming language.

## Project Overview

Building a chess engine is a fascinating challenge that combines computer science theory with practical programming skills. Taures implements sophisticated algorithms for position evaluation, move generation, and game tree search, all while leveraging Rust's memory safety and performance characteristics.

## Key Features

### Move Generation
- **Bitboard representation**: Efficient board state representation using 64-bit integers
- **Magic bitboard attacks**: Fast sliding piece attack generation
- **Legal move validation**: Complete rule enforcement including castling, en passant, and promotion

### Search Algorithm
- **Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning**: Classical game tree search with significant optimization
- **Iterative deepening**: Progressive depth-first search for time management
- **Transposition tables**: Caching of previously evaluated positions
- **Move ordering**: Heuristics to search promising moves first

### Evaluation Function
- **Material balance**: Basic piece value assessment
- **Positional factors**: Piece-square tables for positional understanding
- **King safety**: Evaluation of king protection and pawn structure
- **Endgame knowledge**: Specialized evaluation for endgame positions

## Technical Implementation

The engine is structured around several core modules:

```rust
// Example of the main search function
pub fn search(&mut self, depth: i32, alpha: i32, beta: i32) -> i32 {
    if depth == 0 {
        return self.evaluate();
    }
    
    let moves = self.generate_moves();
    let mut best_score = alpha;
    
    for mv in moves {
        self.make_move(mv);
        let score = -self.search(depth - 1, -beta, -best_score);
        self.undo_move();
        
        if score >= beta {
            return beta; // Beta cutoff
        }
        
        if score > best_score {
            best_score = score;
        }
    }
    
    best_score
}
```

## Performance Optimization

Rust's zero-cost abstractions and memory safety make it an excellent choice for performance-critical applications like chess engines. Key optimizations include:

- **Bitwise operations**: Leveraging CPU bit manipulation instructions
- **Stack allocation**: Minimizing heap allocations during search
- **Branch prediction**: Structuring code to help CPU prediction
- **Cache locality**: Data structures designed for cache efficiency

## Future Development

While Taures already plays competent chess, there are several areas for enhancement:

- **Machine learning integration**: Neural network evaluation functions
- **Opening book**: Database of opening theory and variations
- **Endgame tablebase**: Perfect play in simplified endgame positions
- **UCI protocol**: Standard interface for chess GUI integration
- **Parallel search**: Multi-threaded search for modern multi-core systems

## Challenges and Learnings

Developing a chess engine provided invaluable insights into:

- **Algorithm complexity**: Understanding the exponential nature of game tree search
- **Optimization techniques**: Balancing code clarity with performance requirements
- **Rust ownership model**: Leveraging Rust's unique approach to memory management
- **Testing strategies**: Ensuring correctness in a complex, stateful system

This project represents an ongoing exploration of the intersection between theoretical computer science and practical systems programming, implemented in one of the most exciting modern programming languages.

## Technical Specifications

- **Language**: Rust 2021 Edition
- **Search depth**: Configurable, typically 6-8 ply
- **Nodes per second**: ~500k on modern hardware
- **Memory usage**: Less than 50MB during normal operation
- **Platform**: Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
